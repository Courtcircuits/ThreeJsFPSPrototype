# A Three.js FPS
I have made this project to see how does three.js work. For the moment there is nothing interesting.
The main purpose of this project is to implement most of the concepts present in three.js

## Concepts implemented :
* Mesh
* Geometry -> Primitives (cube)
* Materials/Textures
* Camera
* Game Loop, even though using a game loop system inside three.js would be more clever
